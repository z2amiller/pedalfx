# Smooth Brain Overdrive

The smooth brain overdrive is based on the [PedalPCB 'Tommy III'](https://www.pedalpcb.com/product/tommy/)
which in turn is based on the Paul Cochrane Timmy V3.

This pedal has a good clean boost, as well as a high-gain switch to throw it into overdrive/distortion
territory.

## Internal Controls:

* Internal switch to change diode clipping from symmetric to asymmetric.

## Current Revision: 0.3

## Revision History:

* 0.1:  Initial Version
* 0.2:  Switched some components inadvertantly connected to GND instead of VREF
* 0.3:  Fixed some grounding and op-amp feedback issues.
