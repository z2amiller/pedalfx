# Smooth Brain Overdrive

The smooth brain overdrive is based on the [PedalPCB 'Tommy III'](https://www.pedalpcb.com/product/tommy/)
which in turn is based on the Paul Cochrane Timmy V3.

This pedal has a good clean boost, as well as a high-gain switch to throw it into overdrive/distortion
territory.  This pedal is notable for the way the bass cutoff works, cutting the bass in the first
amiplifier stage to give more clarity to the mids and highs in the later stage.

## Controls

* Volume
* Gain
* Bass
* Treble
* NARF! (Enabling this greatly boosts the gain of the circuit at the cost of more noise)

## Internal Controls:

* Internal switch to change diode clipping from symmetric to asymmetric.

## Current Revision: 0.4

## Revision History:

* 0.4:  Added socket for op-amp and through-hole capacitor to help tune feedback issues.
* 0.3:  Fixed some grounding and op-amp feedback issues.
* 0.2:  Switched some components inadvertantly connected to GND instead of VREF
* 0.1:  Initial Version
