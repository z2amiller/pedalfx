# Octavio

This pedal is based on the delyk pedal schematic of 'Up Down Daddy', which is in turn
based on a trace of the Pearl OC-07 octave pedal.

Like most octave pedals, this works better with the neck pickup.  The 1-Up octave
works much better in the higher registers, it does not do much for the lower
strings.

## Controls

Each control sets the level of that particular octave in the final mix.
For example, you can have only a 2-octave down effect with all of the controls
set to zero except for the 2-down control.

*  Normal
*  1-Up
*  1-Down
*  2-Down
