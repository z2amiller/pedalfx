# Lithium Chorus

This is based on the AionFX Lithium Chorus, which in turn is based on the Small Clone Chorus.

This pedal was famously used by Kurt Cobain on 'Nevermind' and later albums.

## Controls

* Depth (How 'deep' the chorus effect is)
* Rate (How fast the chorus effect is.  
* Blend (How much of the clean signal gets mixed in to the chorused signal)

## Internal Controls

* BIAS:  This trimpot needs to be adjusted to get the chorus effect to work.  There is a fairly narrow
         range where the chorus works most strongly.  This was adjusted 'at the factory' but it's possible
         that it will need to be adjusted again with different power supplies - if the chorus effect
         is weak or missing, try adjusting this.
* Switches:  These red DIP switches affect the 'wobble' of the effect.  More switches in the 'on' position
             makes a more wobbly chorus.  The most vintage version of this pedal had effectively 0 of
             these switches on, the 'modern' version had 2.  You can tune this to get the sound you want.
             It doesn't matter what order you turn them on, only how many are on.
