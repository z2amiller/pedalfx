# Drowning Deep Delay

This is based on the PedalPCB Seabed Delay, which is in turn based on the Mad Professor Deep Blue Delay.

This is a digital delay, based on the PT2399 discrete delay chip.

## Controls

* Level (controls the amount of delayed signal)
* Delay (sets the amount of delay)
* Repeats (controls how many times a signal will repeat)

## Internal Controls

* Volume Trim:  Used to fine-tune the gain of the pedal so it is the same loudness when engaged vs bypassed.
